There are many variations of passages of  Ipsum available , but the  have suffered alteration in some form , by injected humour ,  or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable . If you are going to use a passage of  Ipsum , you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of textmate . All the  Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary , making this the first true generator on the Internet . It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words , combined with a handful of model sentence structures , to generate  Ipsum which looks reasonable . The generated  Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition , injected humour , or non-characteristic words etc.
